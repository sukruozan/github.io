        A range of amphiphilic statistical copolymers is synthesized where the hydrophilic component is either methacrylic acid (MAA) or 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) and the hydrophobic component comprises methyl, ethyl, butyl, hexyl, or 2-ethylhexyl methacrylate, which provide a broad range of partition coefficients (log P). Small-angle X-ray scattering studies confirm that these amphiphilic copolymers self-assemble to form well-defined spherical nanoparticles in an aqueous solution, with more hydrophobic copolymers forming larger nanoparticles. Varying the nature of the alkyl substituent also influenced self-assembly with more hydrophobic comonomers producing larger nanoparticles at a given copolymer composition. A model based on particle surface charge density (PSC model) is used to describe the relationship between copolymer composition and nanoparticle size. This model assumes that the hydrophilic monomer is preferentially located at the particle surface and provides a good fit to all of the experimental data. More specifically, a linear relationship is observed between the surface area fraction covered by the hydrophilic comonomer required to achieve stabilization and the log P value for the hydrophobic comonomer. Contrast variation small-angle neutron scattering is used to study the internal structure of these nanoparticles. This technique indicates partial phase separation within the nanoparticles, with about half of the available hydrophilic comonomer repeat units being located at the surface and hydrophobic comonomer-rich cores. This information enables a refined PSC model to be developed, which indicates the same relationship between the surface area fraction of the hydrophilic comonomer and the log P of the hydrophobic comonomer repeat units for the anionic (MAA) and cationic (DMAEMA) comonomer systems. This study demonstrates how nanoparticle size can be readily controlled and predicted using relatively ill-defined statistical copolymers, making such systems a viable attractive alternative to diblock copolymer nanoparticles for a range of industrial applications.

        Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM) nanogels are a highly researched type of colloidal material. In this work, we establish a versatile asymmetric-flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) method that can provide high resolution particle sizing and also structural information on nanogel samples from 65–310 nm in hydrodynamic diameter and so different chemical compositions. To achieve this online multi-angle light scattering and dynamic light scattering detectors were used to provide measurement of the radius of gyration (Rg) and hydrodynamic radius (Rh) respectively. Two different eluents and a range of cross-flows were evaluated in order to provide effective fractionation and high recovery for the different nanogel samples. We found that using 0.1 M NaNO3 as the eluent and an initial cross-flow of 1 mL min−1 provided optimal separation conditions for all samples tested. Using this method, we analysed two types of samples, pNIPAM nanogels prepared by free radical dispersion polymerisation with increasing diameters and analysed poly(acrylic acid)-b-pNIPAM crosslinked nanogels prepared by reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer dispersion polymerisation. We could determine that the differently sized free radical nanogels possessed differing internal structures; shape factors (Rg/Rh) ranged from 0.58–0.73 and revealed that the smallest nanogel had a homogeneous internal crosslinking density, while the larger nanogels had a more densely crosslinked core compared to the shell. The poly(acrylic acid)-b-pNIPAM crosslinked nanogels displayed clear core–shell structures due to all the crosslinking being contained in the core of the nanogel.

        Liquid formulations have a well-established role in therapeutic embolisation of blood vessels with the widespread use of cyanoacrylate glues, precipitating polymer suspensions, sclerosing agents and viscous emulsions of oil and chemotherapeutic agents. There is currently an emerging market for next generation liquid embolics which aim to address some of the short-comings of the currently used products. These next generation systems use varying chemistries in their approach to formulate new systems including polymerising, precipitating and phase-transitioning mechanisms to form solidified masses in situ within the vasculature. Some of these emerging technologies have been developed to possess improved imaging properties such as inherent radiopacity, rather than relying on having to mixing with radiopaque materials such as tantalum powder and reduction of X-ray imaging artefacts (streaking). Others offer solvent-free formulations which gel on contact with blood thereby allowing precise control over gel formation during the embolisation process without the use of potentially toxic solvents. In this review, we discuss the role of liquid agents in therapeutic embolisation and the potential of emerging technologies under development for use in the next generation of embolics.

        Oral disease greatly affects quality of life, as the mouth is required for a wide range of activities including speech, food and liquid consumption. Treatment of oral disease is greatly limited by the dose forms that are currently available, which suffer from short contact times, poor site specificity, and sensitivity to mechanical stimulation. Mucoadhesive devices prepared using electrospinning offer the potential to address these challenges by allowing unidirectional site‐ specific drug delivery through intimate contact with the mucosa and with high surface areas to facilitate drug release. This review will discuss the range of electrospun mucoadhesive devices that have recently been reported to address oral inflammatory diseases, pain relief, and infections, as well as new treatments that are likely to be enabled by this technology in the future.

        Oral candidiasis is a very common oral condition among susceptible individuals, with the main causative organism being the fungus Candida albicans. Current drug delivery systems to the oral mucosa are often ineffective due to short drug/tissue contact times, as well as increased prevalence of drug-resistant Candida strains. We evaluated the potency of saturated fatty acids as antifungal agents, and investigated their delivery by novel electrospun mucoadhesive oral patches, using agar disc diffusion and biofilm assays. Octanoic (C8) and nonanoic (C9) acids were the most effective at inhibiting C. albicans growth on disc diffusion assays, both in solution or when released from polycaprolactone (PCL) or polyvinylpyrrolidone/RS100 (PVP/RS100) electrospun patches. In contrast, dodecanoic acid (C12) displayed the most potent antifungal activity against C. albicans pre-existing biofilms in solution or when released by PCL or PVP/RS100 patches. Both free and patch-released saturated fatty acids displayed significant toxicity to wild type and azole-resistant strains of C. albicans. These data not only provide evidence that certain saturated fatty acids have the potential to be used as antifungal agents, but also demonstrate that this therapy could be delivered directly to Candida-infected sites using electrospun mucoadhesive patches, demonstrating a potential new therapeutic approach to treat oral thrush.

        The delivery of biopharmaceuticals to the oral mucosa offers a range of potential applications including antimicrobial peptides to treat resistant infections, growth factors for tissue regeneration, or as an alternative to injections for systemic delivery. Existing formulations targeting this site are typically non-specific and provide little control over dose. To address this, an electrospun dual-layer mucoadhesive patch was investigated for protein delivery to the oral mucosa. Lysozyme was used as a model antimicrobial protein and incorporated into poly(vinylpyrrolidone)/Eudragit RS100 polymer nanofibers using electrospinning from an ethanol/water mixture. The resulting fibrous membranes released the protein at a clinically desirable rate, reaching 90 ± 13% cumulative release after 2 h. Dual fluorescent fibre labelling and confocal microscopy demonstrated th homogeneity of lysozyme and polymer distribution. High encapsulation efficiency and preservation of enzyme activity were achieved (93.4 ± 7.0% and 96.1 ± 3.3% respectively). The released lysozyme inhibited the growth of the oral bacterium Streptococcus ratti, providing further evidence of retention of biological activity and illustrating a potential application for treating and preventing oral infections. An additional protective poly(caprolactone) backing layer was introduced to promote unidirectional delivery, without loss of enzyme activity, and the resulting dual-layer patches displayed long residence times using an in vitro test, showing that the adhesive properties were maintained. This study demonstrates that the drug delivery system has great potential for the delivery of therapeutic proteins to the oral mucosa

        Many oral mucosal conditions cause considerable and prolonged pain that to date has been difficult to alleviate via topical delivery, and the use of injection causes many patients dental anxiety and needle-prick pain. Therefore, developing a non-injectable drug delivery system as an alternative administration procedure may vastly improve the health and wellbeing of these patients. Recent advances in the development of mucoadhesive electrospun patches for the direct delivery of therapeutics to the oral mucosa offer a potential solution, but as yet, the release of local anaesthetics from this system and their uptake by oral tissue has not been demonstrated. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of lidocaine-loaded electrospun fibre patches, drug release, and subsequent uptake and permeation through porcine buccal mucosa. Lidocaine HCl and lidocaine base were incorporated into the electrospun patches to evaluate the difference in drug permeation for the two drug compositions. Lidocaine released from the lidocaine HCl-containing electrospun patches was significantly quicker than from the lidocaine base patches, with double the amount of drug released from the lidocaine HCl patches in the first 15 minutes (0.16 ± 0.04 mg) compared to from the lidocaine base patches (0.07 ± 0.01 mg). The permeation of lidocaine from the lidocaine HCl electrospun patches through ex vivo porcine buccal mucosa was also detected in 15 minutes, whereas permeation of lidocaine from the lidocaine base patch was not detected. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation – mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) was used to investigate localisation of lidocaine within oral tissue. Lidocaine in solution as well as from the mucoadhesive patch penetrated into buccal mucosal tissue in a time-dependent manner and was detectable in the lamina propria after only 15 minutes. Moreover, the lidocaine released from lidocaine HCl electrospun patches retained biological activity, inhibiting veratridine-mediated opening of voltage-gated sodium channels in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. These data suggest that a mucoadhesive electrospun patch may be used as a vehicle for rapid uptake and sustained anaesthetic drug delivery and may reduce the need for injection.

        Oncolytic viruses offer many advantages for cancer therapy when administered directly to confined solid tumors. However, the systemic delivery of these viruses is problematic due to host immune response, undesired interactions with blood components and inherent targeting to the liver. Efficacy of systemically administered viruses has been improved by masking viral surface proteins with polymeric materials, through modulation of viral pharmacokinetic profile and accumulation in tumors in vivo. Here we describe a new class of polyvalent reactive based upon poly(N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide) (polyHPMA) with diazonium reactive groups and their application in the modification of the chimeric oncolytic virus Enadenotucirev (EnAd). A series of six reactive copolymers with different chain lengths and density of reactive groups was synthesised and used to coat EnAd. Polymer coating was found to be extremely efficient with concentrations as low as 1 mg/mL resulting in complete (>99%) ablation of neutralising antibody binding. Coating efficiency was found to be dependent on both chain length and reactive group density. Coated viruses were found to have reduced transfection activity both in vitro and in vivo with greater protection against neutralising antibodies resulting in lower transgene production. However, in the presence of neutralising antibodies some in vivo transgene expression was maintained for coated virus compared to the uncoated control. Reduction in transgene expression was found to not be solely due to reduced cellular uptake but due to reducing unpackaging of the virus within the cells and reducing replication indicating that polymer coating does not cause permanent inactivation of the virus. These data suggest that virus activity may be modulated by appropriate design of coating polymers while retaining protection against neutralising antibodies.

        A range of poly(n-butyl methacrylate-stat-methacrylic acid) [P(BMA-stat-MAA)] statistical copolymers of various compositions and molecular weights ranging from 5 to 30 kDa were prepared using either reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) solution copolymerization or conventional free radical polymerization in isopropanol (IPA). On dilution with water, these amphiphilic copolymers self-assembled to form spherical nano-objects as confirmed by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy. Various structural models were examined to extract information regarding the mean nano-object size and morphology. It is found that nano-object radii are independent of copolymer molecular weight but depend on the copolymer composition: the smaller the amount of MAA units in the copolymer chains, the larger the nano-objects that are formed. Combined SAXS and aqueous electrophoretic measurements indicated that most of the MAA units are located at the nano-object surface. Furthermore, SAXS and rheology measurements were used to monitor the effect of solvent composition on the copolymer morphology both at a fixed copolymer concentration (either 1 or 25 wt %) and also for a gradual variation in copolymer concentrations (from 1 to 40 wt %) when adding water to the initial copolymer solution in IPA. These studies revealed that the copolymers are present in solution as molecularly dissolved Gaussian chains when the solvent composition is IPA-rich. However, the copolymer chains self-assemble into spherical nano-objects when the solvent composition is water-rich. At intermediate solvent compositions, SAXS analysis confirmed the formation of an interconnected nano-object network, which accounts for the apparently anomalous increase in solution viscosity on dilution indicated by rheology measurements.

        DNA-based drug delivery vehicles have displayed promise for the delivery of intercalating drugs. Here, we demonstrate that oligonucleotides modified with an alkyl chain can bind to human serum albumin, mimicking the natural binding of fatty acids. These alkyl-DNA–albumin complexes display excellent serum stability and are capable of strongly binding doxorubicin. Complexes are internalized by cells in vitro, trafficking to the mitochondria, and are capable of delivering doxorubicin with excellent efficiency resulting in cell death. However, the cellular localization of the delivered doxorubicin, and ultimately the complex efficacy, is dependent on the nature of the linker between the alkyl group and the oligonucleotide.

These polymers were combined in two ways to form nanoparticles with controllable thermal transition temperatures as measured by particle aggregation. The first technique involved the blending of two (PLA-b-P(DEGMA)-co-(OEGMA)) polymers together prior to assembling nanoparticles (NPs). The second method involved mixing pre-formed nanoparticles of single (PLA-b-P(DEGMA)-co-(OEGMA)) polymers. The observed critical aggregation temperature Tt did not change in a linear relationship with the ratios of each copolymer either in the nanoparticles blended from different copolymers or in the mixtures of pre-formed nanoparticles. However, where co-polymer mixtures were based on (OEG)9MA ratios within 5–10 mole%, a linear relationship between (OEG)9MA composition in the blends and Tt was obtained. The data suggest that OEGMA-based copolymers are tunable over a wide temperature range given suitable co-monomer content in the linear polymers or nanoparticles. Moreover, the thermal transitions of the nanoparticles were reversible and repeatable, with the cloud point curves being essentially invariant across at least three heating and cooling cycles, and a selected nanoparticle formulation was found to be readily endocytosed in representative cancer cells and fibroblasts.

        Intercalation of drugs into assembled DNA systems offers versatile new mechanisms for controlled drug delivery. However, current systems are becoming increasingly complex, reducing the practicality of large scale production. Here, we demonstrate a more pragmatic approach where a short DNA sequence was modified with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) of various lengths at both 5′-termini to provide serum stability and compatibility. The anticancer drug doxorubicin was physically loaded into two designed binding sites on the dsODN. The polymer conjugation improved the stability of the dsODN toward serum nucleases while its doxorubicin binding affinity was unaffected by the presence of the polymers. We examined the effects of polymer size on the dsODN carrier characteristics and studied the resulting DOX@DNA–PEG systems with respect to cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, and localization in A549 and MCF7 cell lines. For the A549 cell line the DOX@DNA-PEG1900 exhibited the best dose response of the conjugates while DOX@DNA-PEG550 was the least potent. In MCF-7, a more doxorubicin sensitive cell line, all conjugates exhibited similar dose response to that of the free drug. Confocal microscopy analysis of doxorubicin localization shows that conjugates successfully deliver doxorubicin to the cell nucleus and also the lysosome. These data provide a valuable insight into the complexities of designing an oligonucleotide based drug delivery system and highlight some practical issues that need to be considered when doing so.

        The effect of protein concentration on solution viscosity in a commercially available biopharmaceutical formulation of recombinant albumin (rAlbumin) was studied. The level of protein aggregation with concentration and its impact on solution viscosity was investigated. Theoretical models predicting viscosity with concentration were applied to these data, and a model that accounts for multiple protein species in solution provided the best fit. The results highlight the need to account for heterogeneity in the level of aggregation when addressing the increase of viscosity observed at high concentrations of protein solutions, a significant issue for the manufacture and use of protein-based therapeutics.

        Polymer–DNA conjugates in which one nucleic acid strand contains fluorine-substituted nucleobases have been prepared and characterised. The efficacy of these novel 19F nucleic acid–polymer conjugates as sensitive and selective in vitro reporters of DNA binding events is demonstrated through a number of rapid-acquisition MR sequences. The conjugates respond readily and in a sequence specific manner to external target oligonucleotide sequences by changes in hybridisation. In turn, these structural changes in polymer–nucleotide conjugates translate into responses which are detectable in fluorine relaxation and diffusion switches, and which can be monitored by in vitro Spin Echo and DOSY NMR spectroscopy. Although complementary to conventional FRET methods, the excellent diagnostic properties of fluorine nuclei make this approach a versatile and sensitive probe of molecular structure and conformation in polymeric assemblies.

        Synthetic polymers containing quaternary phosphonium salts are an emerging class of materials for the delivery of oligo/polynucleotides. In this work, cationic phosphonium salt-containing polymethacrylates and their corresponding ammonium analogues were synthesized by reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer polymerization. Both the nature of the charged heteroatom (N vs P) and the length of the spacer separating the cationic units along the polymer backbone (oxyethylene vs trioxyethylene) were systematically varied. Polymers efficiently bound short interfering RNA (siRNA) at N+/P– or P+/P– ratios of 2 and above. At a 20:1 ratio, small polyplexes (Rh: 4–15 nm) suitable for cellular uptake were formed that displayed low cytotoxicity. While siRNA polyplexes from both ammonium and phosphonium polymers were efficiently internalized by green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing 3T3 cells, no knockdown of GFP expression was observed. However, 65% Survivin gene knockdown was observed when siRNA was replaced with novel, multimerized long interfering RNA in HeLa cells, demonstrating the importance of RNA macromolecular architecture on RNA-mediated gene silencing.

        Poly[N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide] is a promising candidate material for biomedical applications. However, synthesis of functional pHPMA via compolymerization results can lead to variations in monomer composition, molar mass, and dispersity making comparison difficult. Postpolymerization modification routes, most commonly aminolysis of poly[active ester methacrylates], have alleviated some of these problems, but ester hydrolysis can lead to other problems. Here we report the synthesis of multifunctional pHPMA via a simple two-step derivatization of pHPMA homopolymer using readily available standard reagents and atom-efficient procedures. First, treatment with allyl isocyanate yields the corresponding carbamate with predictable incorporation of side-chain functionality. Allyl-pHPMA can then be derivatized further via radical thiol–ene reactions to generate pHPMA with multiple diverse functionalities but without adverse effects on the molecular weight and dispersity of the polymer. The applicability of the method to production of biologically relevant materials is demonstrated by cytocompatibility and cell labeling experiments with easily prepared ligand-functionalized pHPMA in the HCT 116 model cell line.

    abstract: Antifreeze (glyco) proteins (AF(G)Ps) from the blood of polar fish species are extremely potent ice recrystallization inhibitors (IRI), but are difficult to synthesise or extract from natural sources. Despite this challenge, materials which display IRI are appealing due to their ability to enhance cellular cryopreservation, for applications including regenerative and transplantation medicine. Here, poly(ampholytes), which contain a mixture of cationic and anionic side chains are quantitatively evaluated for their IRI activity. Poly(aminoethyl methacrylate), obtained by RAFT polymerization, is functionalised with succinic anhydride to generate the poly(ampholytes). The charge balance of the side chains is shown to be crucial, with only 50 : 50 mixtures having strong IRI activity, which also scales with molecular weight. This is the first example of a non-hydroxylated synthetic polymer with quantifiable IRI activity and raises questions about the mechanism of IRI, as the polymers have no obvious ice-binding motif. The ampholytic structure is shown to be transferable to carbohydrate-centred polymers with activity retained, but poly(betaines) are shown to be inactive.

    abstract: The detection and inactivation of pathogenic strains of bacteria continues to be an important therapeutic goal. Hence, there is a need for materials that can bind selectively to specific microorganisms for diagnostic or anti-infective applications, but that can be formed from simple and inexpensive building blocks. Here, we exploit bacterial redox systems to induce a copper-mediated radical polymerization of synthetic monomers at cell surfaces, generating polymers in situ that bind strongly to the microorganisms that produced them. This ‘bacteria-instructed synthesis’ can be carried out with a variety of microbial strains, and we show that the polymers produced are self-selective binding agents for the ‘instructing’ cell types. We further expand on the bacterial redox chemistries to ‘click’ fluorescent reporters onto polymers directly at the surfaces of a range of clinical isolate strains, allowing rapid, facile and simultaneous binding and visualization of pathogens.

    abstract: Soft micellar nanoparticles can be prepared from DNA conjugates designed to assemble via base pairing such that strands containing a polymer corona and a cholesterol tail generate controlled supramolecular architecture. Functionalization of one DNA conjugate strand with a biorecognition ligand results in shielding of the ligand when in the micelle, while encoding of the DNA sequences with overhangs allows supramolecular unpacking by addition of a complementary strand and sequence-specific unshielding of the ligand. The molecular assembly/disassembly and ‘on–off’ switch of the recognition signal is visualized by FRET pair signalling, PAGE and a facile turbidimetric binding assay, allowing direct and amplified readout of nucleic acid sequence recognition.

    abstract: Combination switchable polymer-DNA hydrogels have been synthesized to respond to both a specific oligonucleotide recognition signal and a non-specific but biorelevant environmental trigger. The hydrogels exhibit rheological properties that can be modulated through interaction with complementary DNA strands and/or reduction. Furthermore, individual and combined oligonucleotide recognition and reduction responses allow control over pore sizes in the gel, enabling programmable release and transport of objects ranging from the nano- to micro-scale.

        - pH responsive materials
    abstract: Responsive materials that change conformation with varying pH have been prepared from a range of amphiphilic block co-polymers. The individual blocks are composed of (a) permanently hydrophilic chains with neutral functionality and (b) acrylate polymers with weakly basic side-chains. Variation in co-monomer content, molar mass and block ratios/compositions leads to a range of pH-responses, manifest through reversible self-assembly into micelles and/or polymersomes. These transitions can be tuned to achieve environmental responses in a pH range from 5–7, as shown by turbidimetric analysis, NMR and dynamic light scattering measurements (DLS). Further characterization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicates that polymersomes with diameters of 100–200 nm can be formed under certain pH-ranges where the weakly basic side-chains are deprotonated. The ability of the systems assembled with these polymers to act as pH-responsive containers is shown by DNA encapsulation and release studies, and their potential for application as vehicle for drug delivery is proved by cell metabolic activity and cell uptake measurements.

    abstract: New classes of information-rich DNA block co-polymer conjugates were synthesised, encoded with thermoresponsive and biocompatible poly(tri(ethylene glycol)ethyl ether methacrylate) (pTriEGMA) chains and oligomeric nucleic acids connected by either bioreducible or non-reducible links. The pTriEGMA chains were grown from initiator-functionalised hybridised DNA, designed to assemble with toehold overhangs. Functional information in the conjugates was explored via dynamic light scattering (DLS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), in order to evaluate (i) reversible self-assembly into supramolecular structures across the pTriEGMA phase transition temperature; (ii) conformational change via addition of competing DNA sequences across the toeholds, and (iii) reductive cleavage of polymer–DNA links. The results showed that discrete nanoscale conjugates could reversibly associate through pTriEGMA phase behaviour and that size and association behaviour in one class of conjugate could be switched by addition of a competing DNA sequence and by reduction to break the polymer–DNA links. Preliminary experiments with the DNA-conjugates as delivery systems for doxorubicin to a cancer cell line indicated good tolerability of the conjugates alone and cytotoxic efficacy when loaded with the drug.

    abstract: Polymer particles consisting of a biodegradable poly[lactide-co-glycolide] (PLGA) core and a thermoresponsive shell have been formulated to encapsulate the dye rhodamine 6G and the potent cytotoxic drug paclitaxel. Cellular uptake of these particles is significantly enhanced above the thermal transition temperature (TTT) of the polymer shells in the human breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 as determined by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Paclitaxel-loaded particles display reduced and enhanced cytotoxicity below and above the TTT respectively compared to unencapsulated drug. The data suggests a potential route to enhanced anti-cancer efficacy through temperature-mediated cell targeting.

    abstract: Amphiphilic polymers have been synthesised by controlled free radical polymerisation techniques. These polymers self-assemble into well-defined vesicles in aqueous conditions, enabling encapsulation of a model hydrophilic molecule. The polymeric vesicles show high stability against a range of aqueous conditions with marginal release of cargo, even in the presence of known cell-membrane disruptive polymers such as branched poly(ethylene imine) (b-PEI). This stability allows for inversion of the surface charge of the polymeric vesicles by a simple coating protocol leading to an enhanced uptake by mammalian cells.

    abstract: Many difficulties in treating cancer arise from the problems in directing highly cytotoxic agents to the deseased tissues, cells and intracellular compartments. Many drug delivery systems have been devised to address this problem, including those that show a change in properties in response to a temperature stimulus. In particular, colloidal materials based on thermoresponsive polymers offer a means to transport drugs selectively into tumour tissues that are hyperthermic, either intrinsically or through the application of clinical procedures such as localised heating. In this paper, the key attributes of thermoresponsive polymer colloids are considered, a number of important recent examples are discussed and the possible future developments of these materials are evaluated.

    abstract: Mono- and polyvalent galactosides have been investigated with respect to their binding to the plant lectin Ricinus communis agglutinin 120 (RCA120). Thermodynamic parameters (Ka, ΔG, ΔH, ΔS and n) have been determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and kinetics of binding (ka and kd) measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). ITC analysis using a single set of sites model found a non-statistical increase in avidity with increasing valency with the largest ligand displaying a greater than 20-fold increase in Ka compared to its monomeric precursor after correction for valency; binding was found to be enthalpically driven. SPR analysis supports the avidity increase but values of Ka observed were up to 100-fold greater than those measured by ITC. The large discrepancy between the two measurements is rationalized by the polyvalent–polyvalent interaction that is measured by SPR.

It was revealed that only polymers bearing hydroxyl groups in the side chain could inhibit ice growth. Furthermore, well-defined glycopolymers were shown to have a small but significant recrystallization inhibition effect, showing that it may be possible to design antifreeze glycoprotein mimics based upon polymers derived from vinyl monomers.

    abstract: Well-defined polymers with carbohydrate residues pendant to the main chain (glycopolymers) were prepared by reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerisation. Excellent control over molecular weight and narrow polydispersities (1.1–1.2) were achieved over a range of molecular weights. In addition, efficient synthesis of block copolymers by sequential monomer addition with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic non-carbohydrate blocks was demonstrated. The aqueous solution behaviour of amphiphilic block glycopolymers was investigated, revealing the formation of multivalent carbohydrate-bearing aggregates in solution with the capability for the solubilisation of hydrophobic species (a water-insoluble dye). One such amphiphilic glycopolymer shows by TEM the formation of a worm-like micelle phase. Further investigations of these novel bioactive macromolecular assemblies are underway.

    abstract: Glycopolymers are receiving increasing interest due to their application in areas, such as glycomics, medicine, biotechnology, sensors, and separation science. Consequently, new methods for their synthesis are constantly being developed, with an increasing emphasis on the preparation of well‐defined polymers and on the production of complex macromolecular architectures such as stars. This review covers recent developments in the synthesis of glycopolymers, with a particular emphasis on (i) the use of controlled radical polymerization to prepare well‐defined glycopolymers from unprotected monomers and (ii) postpolymerization modification strategies using reactive polymer precursors (including “click” reactions). Recent work on the production of glycosylated polypeptides, which are under investigation as mimics of naturally occurring glycoproteins, is also included. The authors offer some suggestions as to future developments and remaining challenges in this topical area of polymer chemistry.
