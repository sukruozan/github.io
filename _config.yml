          <mark>PhD Thesis Abstract:</mark> In this thesis, we aim to capture realistic geometrical descriptions of real world
          scenes and objects with a special effort to characterize reflection properties.
          After a brief review of the stereo imaging literature, we show our contributions
          to enhance stereo matching performance by identifying and eliminating specular surface
          reflections. The identification of specular reflection can be done both passively and actively.
          We use dichromatic-based methods to identify and eliminate specular reflections
          passively. We utilize polarization imaging methods to do the same job actively.
          In this work we also study structured light based methods that can give better
          reconstruction results compared to stereo imaging methods. We propose three laser scanners
          equipped with a pair of line lasers and a method to calibrate these systems. Another
          convenient way to obtain good surface reconstruction results using structured light is to
          use projectors that can be used as a light source that project complicated patterns. We
          show our results from a digital camera-projector-based scanning system as well. This
          system can robustly generate a very dense reconstruction of surfaces.
          We also use the projector based scanning system to determine the surface reflection
          properties. Using high dynamic range imaging (HDRI) techniques makes it possible
          for us to estimate scene radiance values. Since we can determine the incoming and outgoing
          light directions, we are able to measure bidirectional reflectance distribution function
          (BRDF) values from reconstructed surface points for corresponding directions. If the
          sample surface have not only diffuse reflection components but also a sufficient amount
          of specular highlights, it is possible to approximate BRDF corresponding to a surface by
          fitting an analytical BRDF model to the measured data. In our work we preferred to use
          Phong BRDF model. Finally, we present results with rendered synthetic images where the parameter
          values of the Phong model were estimated using scans of real objects.

          <mark>MSc Thesis Abstract:</mark> Automatically recognizing and analyzing visual activities in complex nenvironments is a challenging and open-ended problem. In this thesis this problem domain is visited in a chess game scenario where the rules, actions and the environment are well defined. The purpose here is to detect and observe a FIDE (Federation International des Echecs) compatible chess board and to generate a log file of the moves made by human players. A series of basic image processing operations have been applied to perform the desired task. The first step of automatically detecting a chess board is followed by locating the positions of the pieces. After the initial setup is established every move made by a player is automatically detected and verified. A PC-CAM connected to a PC is used to acquire images and implement the corresponding software. For convenience, .Intel R Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV). is used in the current software implementation.

          <mark>Abstract:</mark>This work presents a practical solution to the problem of call center agent malpractice. A semi-supervised framework comprising nonlinear power transformation, neural feature learning, and clustering is outlined. We put these building blocks together and tuned the parameters to obtain the best performance. The data used in the experiments is obtained from our in-house call center. It is made up of recorded agent–customer conversations, which have been annotated using a convolutional neural network (CNN) based segmenter. The methods provided a means of tuning the neural network parameters to achieve a desirable result. Using our proposed framework, we show that it is possible to significantly reduce the malpractice classification error of k-means and agglomerative clustering models, which would serve the same purpose. By presenting the amount of silence per call as a key performance indicator, we show that the proposed system has increased the efficiency of quality control managers, thus enhancing agents’ performance at our call center since deployment.

          <mark>Abstract:</mark>This study used the BERT model to automatically classify ad texts created on online advertising platforms according to the industry. Our training dataset consists of approximately 101.000 advertisement texts from 44 different sectors labeled with the relevant sector names. It has been observed that the classification performance is low for specific sectors. It has been understood that this is due to some outlier advertising texts in the relevant training dataset. For this reason, the Zero-Shot Learning method, which is a current method in natural language processing (NLP), was used to automatically determine the suitability of the sector and advertisement text and perform a preprocessing for the data set. After this preprocessing study, it was observed that the classification performance of the BERT model, which was retrained with the cleaned data set, increased significantly.

        description: |
          <mark>Abstract:</mark> Identifying the authors of a given set of text is a well addressed and complicated task. It requires thorough knowledge of different authors’ writing styles and discriminating them. As the main contribution of this paper, we propose to perform this task using machine learning and deep learning methods, state-of-the-art algorithms, and methods used in numerous complex Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems. We used a text corpus of daily newspaper columns written by thirty authors to perform our experiments. The experimental results proved that document embeddings trained via neural network architecture achieve cutting edge accuracy in learning writing styles and identifying authors of given writings even though the dataset has a considerably unbalanced distribution. We represent our experimental results and outsource our codes for interested readers and natural language processing (NLP) enthusiasts as a GitHub repository. They can reproduce and confirm the results and modify them according to their own needs.

        description: |
          <mark>Abstract:</mark> How can we use a text corpus stored in a customer relationship management (CRM) database for data mining and segmentation? To answer this question, we inherited the state of the art methods commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) literature, such as word embeddings, and deep learning literature, such as recurrent neural networks (RNN). We used the text notes from a CRM system taken by customer representatives of an internet ads consultancy agency between 2009 and 2020. We trained word embeddings by using the corresponding text corpus and showed that these word embeddings could be used directly for data mining and used in RNN architectures, which are deep learning frameworks built with long short-term memory (LSTM) units, for more comprehensive segmentation objectives. The obtained results prove that we can use structured text data populated in a CRM to mine valuable information. Hence, any CRM can be equipped with useful NLP features once we correctly built the problem definitions and conveniently implement the solution methods.

        description: |
          <mark>Abstract:</mark> When a robust and dense surface reconstruction is aimed, structured light imaging techniques are usually much appreciated. In this paper we propose a method to reconstruct both geometrical and reflective properties of surfaces by using structured light imaging. We use a technique where a camera and a projector are both treated as viewing devices. They are calibrated in the same manner. Each visible point can be correctly located on both image planes without solving a correspondence problem; hence, a dense reconstruction can be obtained. Since both the camera and the projector are explicitly calibrated, lighting and viewing directions can be identified for each surface point. It is also possible to measure reflected radiance by using high dynamic range (HDR) images for each surface point. The lighting and viewing directions that are known after calibration are combined with the reflected radiance and the incoming irradiance measurements to determine the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) values of the material at the reconstructed surface points. We illustrate the reconstruction of surface reflection properties of sample surfaces by fitting the Phong BRDF model to the BRDF measurements.

        description: |
          <mark>Abstract:</mark> In this study, 3D scanning systems that utilize a pair of laser stripes are studied. Three types of scanning systems are implemented to scan environments, rough surfaces of near planar objects and small 3D objects. These scanners make use of double laser stripes to minimize the undesired effect of occlusions. Calibration of these scanning systems is crucially important for the alignment of 3D points which are reconstructed from different stripes. In this paper, the main focus is on the calibration problem, following a treatment on the pre-processing of stripe projections using dynamic programming and localization of 2D image points with sub-pixel accuracy. The 3D points corresponding to laser stripes are used in an optimization procedure that imposes geometrical constraints such as coplanarities and orthogonalities. It is shown that, calibration procedure proposed here, significantly improves the alignment of 3D points scanned using two laser stripes.

          Ozan Ş. Gümüştekin Ş., Enhancing stereo matching performance by colour normalisation and specularity removal, 2011; 47(20): 1124-1125.
        description: |
          <mark>Abstract:</mark> A method to enhance the performance of stereo matching is presented. The position of the specular light reflection on an object surface varies due to the change in the position of the camera, light source, object or all combined. Additionally, there may be situations exhibiting a colour shift owing to a change in the light source chromaticity or camera white balance settings. These variations cause misleading results when stereo matching algorithms are applied. In this reported work, a single-image-based statistical method is used to normalise source images. This process effectively eliminates non-saturated specularities regardless of their positions on the object. The effect of specularity removal is tested on stereo image pairs.
